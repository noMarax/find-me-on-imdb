# Find me on IMDb

**Find me on IMDb** is just a practical work I did (in a few hours) to learn the basics of AngularJS.  
This project lets you find movies, TV shows, actors, and many other cool stuff by just taping their name.

*In fact it kinda does the same thing that this, but.. come on ! It was a really funny practical work !*
